# Creating & Teaching HyFlex, Active Learning Workshops

- Pre-workshop activities: 00 min 
- Introductory presentation: 00 min
- Hands-on activities: 00-00 min

## Why HyFlex, Active Learning Workshops? 

"Learning is not a spectator sport!" ([Chickering & Gamson, 1987](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228044220_Seven_Principles_of_Good_Practice_in_Undergraduate_Education)) HyFlex, Active Learning Workshops a user-friendly and free web-based tool that helps researchers to code and analyse their qualitative data. Taguette is a great tool for those who need to analyze interviews, reports, transcripts of any kinds, and a variety of text. With the tool, we can create codes and analyse texts easily and export in different file formats. If you have some or a lot of text to analyse, Taguette might be a great option for you.

## Learning objectives - UPDATE FOR THE NEW TOOL

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

1. Describe how an active HyFlex workshop functions, and what are its strengths and weaknesses for teaching digital fluency skills.
2. Use a backward design methodology to create three or more SMART learning outcomes for a digital fluency workshop before creating pre-class activities, or in-class activities.
2. When designing workshop activities, you will use teaching methods to differentiate the learning experiences for learners of different abilities (i.e. enable learners to work at their own pace).
3. Identify ways to help connect the new skills being learned into knowledge the learners already have in the in-class activity.
4. Find or create appropriate pre-workshop videos and/or readings to prepare learners for the face-to-face hands-on activities.
5. Create alternate asynchronous activities for participants who cannot attend synchronous sessions; alternate activities will achieve the same learning objectives, but usually in different ways.
6. Create an outline for a new workshop in the following order: learning outcomes, in-class activities, pre-class prep quiz, pre-class videos, and finally, post-class assessment.
7. Describe the difference between leading a workshop as a “Guide on the Side” as opposed to as a “Sage on the Stage.”
8. Model best practices for leading a HyFlex digital fluency workshop, including energy level, introductions, and identifying participants who need help and aren’t asking for it.
