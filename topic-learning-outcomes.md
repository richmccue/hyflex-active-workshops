# Choosing a Topic & Creating Learning Outcomes

1. We have provided a workshop template for you to use, to help you organize your workshop, and you can either use a printed copy of the template provided by the workshop instructor or open the template below and make a copy for yourself to use as you create your own workshop: 
- Open Instructor outline template (a Google Doc): http://bit.ly/2SKcBf6 
- **File** -> **Make a Copy…**   Give your workshop an appropriate name. You may want to put this handout and the

2. Select your workshop topic for today:
- Select or create a topic for an introductory workshop that you would like to create. The topic should be something that you have some interest or expertise in, as well as the tools and classroom space to effectively teach. You can always change your topic, and you don't need to turn this into a real workshop, so don't worry about having a high quality topic for the workshop. The point is to have a topic that you can practice turing into a high quality workshop outline.
- Some example introductory workshop topics are: “Introduction to 3D Design & Printing,’” “Introduction to Version Control with GitHub,” “Introduction to - Programmable Electronics with Arduino,” or “Introduction to Augmented Reality with HP Reveal.”
- **Make the topic you just chose the title of your workshop template.** Please take a few minutes and decide what your workshop topic will be for the workshop, and it down. 

3. As you create learning outcomes for your topic, make sure you keep your target audience in mind:
- Who is your audience? What is their age and education level? Do they have experience with the topic you chose, or something closely related?
- What do you think they would like to get out of the workshop collectively and as individuals? Don’t be afraid to ask your colleagues, and prospective students what they would like to get out of the workshop. Occasionally you may find that the specific topic you chose is not as popular as you thought it was, so you may need to tweak or abandon the topic.
- The Curse of Expertise (Fisher & Keil, 2016): 
  - If you have significant experience or expertise in the area of the workshop, it is often difficult to remember what things or skills that you don’t need to explain in detail and which you’ll have to elaborate on. 
  - To guard against “the curse of expertise,” beta-test your workshop with a trusted novice so that you can get accurate feedback on what areas and words that need more explanation, and which areas you may have elaborated on too much.
